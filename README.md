 Have fun with neural networks

## What's done
* MNIST
  * A fully connected network with PyTorch
    * Achieved 97% accuracy
  * A convolutional neural network with PyTorch
    * Achieved 99% accuracy
  * A handmade FC network with NumPy
    * Achieved 95% accuracy with a simple SGD
      * Momentum alone didn't really help
